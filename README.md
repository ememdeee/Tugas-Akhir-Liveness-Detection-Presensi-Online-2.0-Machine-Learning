## Quick explanation
This is the web-based app that I made for my thesis with the title Liveness Detection using Tensorflow.js This web app allowed the company to record presence data for their employment with the provision of the employee should be in the office (we track the employee location) and employee need to do Face Recognition (so they can't ask a friend to input their presence) + Liveness Detection (to prevent their using photo or video in face recognition)

All the app is available on the website so the employee can use this easily and with all device. The implementation of liveness detection and face recognition on the web is using a Machine Learning library called Tensorflow.js. and for the back end, I am using Laravel Framework.
