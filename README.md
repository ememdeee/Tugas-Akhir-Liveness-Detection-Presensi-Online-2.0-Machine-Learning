## Quick explanation
This is the web based app that i make for my thesis with title Liveness Detection using Tensorflow.js
This apps allowed company to record pressence data for their employee with the provision of the employee should be in the office (we track the employee location) and employee need to do Face Recognition (so they can't ask they friend to do pressence) + Liveness Detection (to prevent their using photo or video in face recognition)

All the app is available in website so employee can use this easly and with all device. 
The implementation of liveness detection and face recognition in web is using Machine Learning liblary called Tensorflow.js. and for the back end iam using Laravel Framework.
